Those who work in secrecy and trickery often ask for her blessing. God of the moon and autumn, Sehanine is the patron of trickery and illusions. She has close ties to [[Corellon]] and [[Melora]] and is a favourite deity among Elves and Halflings. She is also the god of love, who sends shadows to cloak loversâ€™ trysts.

- Follow your goals and seek your own destiny.
    
- Keep to the shadows, avoiding the blazing light of zealous good, and the utter darkness of evil.
    
- Seek new horizons and new experiences, and let nothing tie you down.
