Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon is the deity of good-aligned dragons and metallic dragons. He is a sworn enemy of [[Tiamat]], the Scaled Tyrant, who is the queen of the chromatic dragons. Lawful good Paladins often revere him, and metallic dragons worship him as the first of their kind. Monarchs are crowned in his name.

While mortals generally use silver dragons to represent Bahamut (since their scales are the most similar to platinum among the metallic dragons), the divine form of the Platinum Dragon is different: he appears as a gargantuan true dragon of immense wingspan and vibrant platinum scales, although with a combination of features unlike any other, and surrounded by a shiny iridescent aura.
