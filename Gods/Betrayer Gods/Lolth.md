**Lolth, the Spider Queen** is the evil god of deceit, shadows, and spiders. She is known for weaving a complicated web of schemes and treachery through her worshipers, deceiving allies and enemies alike to gain power. Her worship is entwined with the drow society. She holds a searing grudge against [[Kord]] after he impaled her against a cliffside during the Calamity. The Spider Queen and [[Gruumsh]] have similar hatred for [[Corellon]] whom she claims drove her children below the earth and she often manipulates the Ruinerâ€™s followers into attacking her enemies. The only being the Spider Queen truly fears is the Chained Oblivion. Lolth is the chaotic evil god of shadow, lies, and spiders. Scheming and treachery are her commands, and her priests are a constant force of disruption in the otherwise stable society of the evil Drow. Though she is properly a god and not a demon, she is called Demon Queen of Spiders.
