**Asmodeus, the Lord of the Nine Hells** is the devil god of the Nine Hells and represents mastery of tyranny and domination. He relishes in corrupting mortal souls with his honeyed words. He rules his domain with an iron fist and the punishments he inflicts for crossing him are legendary. Devils and other evil entities pay him tribute, while warlocks are drawn to his power.

------

- Seek power over others, that you might rule with strength as the Lord of Hell does.
- Repay evil with evil. If others are kind to you, exploit their weakness for your own gain.
- Show neither pity nor mercy to those who are caught underfoot as you climb your way to power. The weak do not deserve compassion.
