Gruumsh, the Ruiner, is the chaotic evil god who commands hordes of barbaric marauders across Volant to destroy, pillage, and slaughter. Gruumsh is the chaotic evil god of destruction, lord of marauding hordes. Where Bane commands conquest, Gruumsh exhorts his followers to slaughter and pillage. Orcs are his fervent followers, and they bear a particular hatred for Elves because [[Corellon]] put out one of Gruumshâ€™s eyes. The One-Eyed God gives simple orders to his followers:

- Conquer and destroy.
- Let your strength crush the weak.
- Do as you will, and let no one stop you.
