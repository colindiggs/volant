**Torog, the Crawling King**, is an evil god of torturers, slavers, and jailers. His worshippers are those who take others' freedom and creatures living in the darkness below. It is said that pathways under the world are the result of his tears of pain and anger, and his realm is a network of deadly caves and manacles. Torog is the evil god of The Underdark, patron of jailers and torturers. Common superstition holds that if his name is spoken, the King the Crawls burrows up from below and drags the hapless speaker underground to an eternity of imprisonment and torture. Jailers and torturers pray to him in deep caves and cellars, and creatures of The Underdark revere him as well.
