Vecna, also known as **the Whispered One, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower**, was a powerful, mortal-born archlich who achieved godhood. Vecna is the evil god of undead, necromancy, and secrets. He rules that which is not meant to be known and that which people wish to keep secret. Evil spellcasters and conspirators pay him homage.

### Appearance
------
When Vecna was first reborn, he appeared as a gaunt husk of a man wearing long tattered red, purple, and black robes. His skin was weathered and decayed, pulled taut against his skeletal frame; there was no hair on his spotted head. His cheeks were sunken around skeletal teeth in a terrible grin. His left hand was missing, and where his left eye would be just an empty socket constantly streaming sickly green magical energy upwards.

When he later appeared in incorporeal form, he was wearing beautiful, crushed velvet robes with gold trim, and had adorned himself with lavish gems, baubles, and other jewelry. His right eye was a sickly pale blue.
### Tenants of Faith

- Never reveal all that you know.
- Find the seed of darkness in your heart and nourish it; find it in others and exploit it to your advantage.
- Oppose the followers of all other deities so that Vecna alone can rule the world.
