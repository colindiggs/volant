Beneath an ever-changing sky the floating continent of Volant hangs suspended, a realm defined by the echoes of three ages. The eras of times past are more than ancient history. Its turbulent history, a tapestry woven with threads of emergence, conflict, and renewal, whispers secrets the struggles they face in their daily lives were set in motion by the turbulent events of past ages. 

### The First Age of Flight 
In the dawn of time, the benevolent hands of the [[Prime Deities]] meticulously crafted the foundations of Volant, a paradise suspended in the open sky. Yet, ambition knows no bounds. The [[Betrayer Gods]] sought to rival the divine creations, birthing goblins, giants, orcs, and other exotic beings that would forever alter the course of Volant's history. The [[Raven Queen]]'s ascension into godhood, aligned with the forces of good, tipped the scales, but the struggle persisted.

As civilizations rose, the demand for flight and power grew. Scarred by jagged mountain ranges and coated in thick forests, Volant's lands are best travelled by air. The founding of [[Aethos]] marked the onset of the first age of flight, and with it an era of slavery. The [[Iron Keep]], a symbol of oppression, stood tall for thousands of years, until a revolution in 3000 BG shattered the chains that bound the enslaved. Still, the immense greed of Volant's populace pushed the [[Betrayer Gods]]
into powe
Pushed to the brink of Volant, the remaining free citizens banded together with the [[Prime Deities]] to contest 
### The Divine Exodus

In the aftermath of the Gods-Clash, Volant entered an era of divine silence known as the Divine Exodus. The continent, unshackled from divine intervention, witnessed the establishment of the Edgelands Council in 1 AG. The Crailin Monarchy expanded into the Redlands, claiming territory from wild creatures.

The Stone Gardens produced mystical stones, and Sanctaphrax was established as educators flocked to study the rock. Aristocracy flourished on the Sanctaphrax stone, eventually leading to the establishment of Finkletown and the ascension of the Edgelands Council to the rock.

### The Second Age of Flight
Peace and progress flourished, ushering in the Age of Rationalism. Yet, shadows loomed as the skygrave returned in 1510 AG, sparking conflict and raiding. The fragile peace shattered in 1620 AG, as slavery resurfaced, and skirmishes erupted over vital resources, including coveted phraxshards.

Now, in 1623 AG, the continent of Volant stands at a crossroads. The skygrave hovers, a symbol of independence, while the specter of conflict lingers. Will you be the architects of a new era or the pawns in a tapestry woven by the winds of fate? As the winds whisper ancient secrets, your journey in the ever-changing skies of Volant is about to begin.
