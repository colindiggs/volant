Beneath an ever-changing sky the floating continent of Volant hangs suspended, a realm defined by the echoes of three ages. The eras of times past are more than ancient history. Its turbulent history, a tapestry woven with threads of emergence, conflict, and renewal, whispers secrets the struggles they face in their daily lives were set in motion by the turbulent events of past ages. 

### The First Age of Flight 
*The Dawn of time (12,000 BG) - The Gods-Clash (0 BG)*
In the dawn of time, the benevolent hands of the [[Prime Deities]] meticulously crafted the foundations of Volant, a paradise suspended in the open sky. Yet, ambition knows no bounds. The [[Betrayer Gods]] sought to rival the divine creations, birthing goblins, giants, orcs, and other exotic beings that would forever alter the course of Volant's history. The [[Raven Queen]]'s ascension into godhood in 7249 BG, aligned with the forces of good, tipped the scales, but the struggle persisted.

As civilizations rose, the demand for flight and power grew. Scarred by jagged mountain ranges and coated in thick forests, Volant's lands are best travelled by air. The founding of [[Aethos]] in 7200 BG marked the onset of the first age of flight, and with it an era of slavery. The [[Iron Keep]], a symbol of oppression, stood tall for thousands of years, facilitating a great and terrible currency of faith and labor. Over time the lust for power and control over the continent grew, and the [[Betrayer Gods]] tightened their grip.

In a desperate attempt to wrestle control from the [[Betrayer Gods]], the [[Prime Deities]] launched an full assault, called the Gods-Clash. During the battle, the moon goddess [[Sehanine]] was felled, and chunks of her domain were said to rain down upon Volant like starlight. After the tragedy, the [[Prime Deities]] created the divine gate, sealing away the [[Betrayer Gods]] and themselves for eternity. 
### The Divine Exodus 
*Post Gods-Clash (0 AG) - The Second Invention of Flight (701 AG)*
In the aftermath of the Gods-Clash, Volant entered an era of divine silence known as the Divine Exodus. The continent, unshackled from divine intervention and slavery, witnessed the establishment of the [[Edgelands Council]], a democratic rule for free citizens. The [[Crailan Monarchy]] elected to preserve its generational rule, expanding into the [[Redlands]], claiming territory from wild creatures.

Much to the surprise of the [[Edgelands]], the largest impact site of the [[Sehanine]]'s fall began to birth  mystical stones that float in the air. The first stone was large enough to hold a city, and quickly chained to the edge of Volant. Researches flocked to study its properties, and eventually decided to take permanent residence on its surface, creating the city of [[Sanctaphrax]]. Aristocracy flourished on the [[Sanctaphrax]] stone when [[Edgelands Council]] took to the rock.

As the [[Edgelands Council]] scuffled over the [[Crailin Monarchy]], religious tensions ignited the 7-year war in 1030 AG. Peace was brokered in 1037 AG, with Princess [[Adelphea Crailin]] pursuing romance with war hero [[Leonessa Van Brut]].
### The Second Age of Flight
*The Second Invention of Flight (701 AG) - Present (1623 AG)*
Peace and trade flourished, ushering in the Second Age of Flight. Yet, shadows loomed as the skygrave returned in 1510 AG, sparking conflict and raiding. The fragile peace shattered in 1620 AG, as slavery resurfaced, and skirmishes erupted over vital resources, including coveted phraxshards.

Now, in 1623 AG, the continent of Volant stands at a crossroads. The skygrave hovers, a symbol of independence, while the specter of conflict lingers. Will you be the architects of a new era or the pawns in a tapestry woven by the winds of fate? As the winds whisper ancient secrets, your journey in the ever-changing skies of Volant is about to begin.
